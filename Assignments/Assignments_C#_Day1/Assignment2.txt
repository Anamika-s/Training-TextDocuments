 You have to create a small project based nthe following scenarios:

 Accept a sentence and perform the following opearations on that:

 1) Count no. of characters in the sentence
 2) Count no. of words in a sentence
 3) Reverse a sentence
 4) Check whether the sentence is palindrome or not.
 5) Count number of vowels, consonants , integers and special characters in the sentence.
 
 NOTE : You will declare functions and in every function you wil pass string variable 

for eg:

	 int count_no_char(string temp)
	{
	....
	....
	return no_of_chars;
	}
 
 Now take two strings and perform the following operations:

 1) Compare them
 2) Copy one string to other
 3) Combine them and give third string

 NOTE : You will declare functions and in every function you wil pass 2 string variables 

for eg:

	 bool compare(string temp, string temp2)
	{
	....
	....
	return true/false;
	}
 Take two numbers and perform following functions on them,

 1) Addition,subtraction,multiplication,division (Pass two numbers and this function should return result of sum, difference, product and multiplication)
 2) Print all tables from in between these two numbers
 3) Print all prime numbers between these two numbers

NOTE : You will declare functions and in every function you wil pass 2 integer variables 

for eg:

	 void tableint n1, int n2)
	{
	....
	....
	return;
	}
