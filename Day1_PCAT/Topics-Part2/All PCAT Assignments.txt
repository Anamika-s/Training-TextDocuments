Assignment 1: Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.

Assignment 2: Flowchart Creation - Design a flowchart that outlines the logic for a user login process. It should include conditional paths for successful and unsuccessful login attempts, and a loop that allows a user three attempts before locking the account.


Day 1: Assignment 3: Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization."

Day 2: Assignment 1: Pseudocode and Flowchart for Sorting Algorithm - Write pseudocode and create a flowchart for a bubble sort algorithm. Provide a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and a simple array of integers to demonstrate a dry run of your algorithm.

Assignment 2: Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and time complexity."
